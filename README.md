# Hello World in Docker with Jupyter Notebook

This project by Muhammad Sami Asghar Mughal demonstrates a basic setup for running a "Hello World" program inside a Docker container using Jupyter Notebook.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and run this project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

### Project Structure

```
hello-world-docker/
│
├── Dockerfile       # Docker configuration file
└── README.md        # Project documentation
```

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/hello-world-docker.git
   cd hello-world-docker
   ```

2. **Build the Docker Image**

   Build the Docker image using the provided `Dockerfile`:

   ```bash
   docker build -t hello-world-jupyter .
   ```

3. **Run the Docker Container**

   Start a Docker container from the image and launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   docker run -p 8888:8888 hello-world-jupyter
   ```

4. **Access Jupyter Notebook**

   After running the container, a URL with a token will be displayed in the terminal. Copy this URL and open it in your web browser to access Jupyter Notebook.

5. **Run "Hello World"**

   - In Jupyter Notebook, create a new Python 3 notebook.
   - In the first cell, type:

     ```python
     print("Hello, World!")
     ```

   - Run the cell to see the output.

## Troubleshooting

- **Docker Connection Issues:** Ensure Docker Desktop is running and fully initialized before building the image.
- **Jupyter Notebook Access:** Make sure the port `8888` is available and not blocked by other applications.
